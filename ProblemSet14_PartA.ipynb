    "Most of us will think of an *orbit* as the trajectory of a mass moving in a gravitational field. A more mathematical definition is a collection of points\n",
    "in the phase space of a dynamical system. For example, the two-dimensional phase space for a simple pendulum (constrained to move in a plane) has as one dimension the angle of the bob $\\theta$ and as the other the bob's angular velocity $d\\theta/dt$. For small amplitudes of oscillation, the orbit of the pendulum in this phase space is a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a dynamical system, an *evolution function* takes the current point in the orbit and maps it to the next point. In the two examples just given, this mapping is a continuous function, and the orbit is a continuous curve. The parameter which changes as we move along the orbit is the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "At any point on the orbit $p$, the evolution function takes that point to a new point $p+dp$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of the pendulum, we can define a point in phase space by $p = (\\theta, d\\theta/dt)$. You all know how to determine the angular acceleration of the pendulum bob $a(\\theta)$. With this, we can map the current point to a new point further along the orbit, $p+dp$, with $dp$ given in terms of $dt$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{split} d\\theta &= \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right) dt \\\\\n",
    "                 d\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right) &= a(\\theta) dt\\end{split} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also define a dynamical system in which the mapping is *discrete*. Instead of having a continuous parameter like time, we simply count the number of times we apply the evolution function. So, if we start at a point $z_0$ in the phase space, the orbit is then the set of points $z_0, z_1, z_2, \\dots$ given by repeatedly applying some function $f(z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_{n+1} = f(z_n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterated map fractal sets we will look at are generated by the behavior of orbits as a function of the point in the phase space used as the initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most famous of these fractal sets is known as the Mandelbrot set, named after Benoit Mandelbrot. Here, we choose as our phase space the complex plane. We will choose the origin $z_o=0$ as our starting point for all orbits and explore the orbits  generated by the iterated map\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_{n+1} = f_c(z_n) = z_n^2 + c $$\n",
    "\n",
    "at each point $c$ of the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there are two possible classes of orbits. The first starts at zero and becomes larger in magnitude at each iteration. These trajectories go off to infinity; they are said to diverge. For example, take the orbit with $c=1$ on the real axis. Starting at $z=0$, this trajectory is along the real axis, with the first few values\n",

    "To understand how this works, we need to make a distinction between two kinds of computer languages. The first kind is a *compiled* language. For such languages (C, C++, Fortran, and many others), you give you program to a *compiler* which looks at the entire program at once. This compiler may take a while to run, but it is able to make many changes to your code which, while not changing the result, allow it to run much faster -- this is known as compiler *optimization* and is one of the reasons that code in compiled languages usually run much faster than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other class of computer languages is the *interpreted* languages, of which Python is one. Interpreted languages run an *interpreter* which is in many ways like a compiler, but only considers you code one line at a time, executing it before moving on to the next. This prevents an interpreted language from doing much in the way of optimization. The other side of the coin is that a user doesn't have to wait for their program to be compiled. When you hit shift+enter in a notebook, this means you don't have to wait several seconds to minutes for your code to compile -- it starts right away even though it may not finish as quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade or so, this distinction has begun to blur as the designers of interpreted languages have begun to incorporate features of compiled languages. One such attempt in the \"just in time\" compiler. Such a compiler only compiles code right when it is about to be executed. The first execution of a compiled function is thus somewhat slower, but after that, any subsequent calls to the function run much more quickly.\n",

To signal to Python that you want to use just-in-time compilation for a function, you use the Python *decorator* @jit from the `numpy` module just before the function definition. Using just in time compilation often avoids most of the penalty for using otherwise slow language constructs like for loops in Python.\n",
