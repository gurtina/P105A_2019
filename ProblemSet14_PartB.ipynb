    "### Matplotlib widgets and GUIs\n",
    "\n",
    "To create such a tool, we will need to use some graphical widgets -- helpful functions to make a \"graphical user interface\", or GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "These widgets need to be able to take input from the mouse and keyboard while the program is running. The most common way this is achieved is to have the code run in an infinite loop which is interrupted whenever input is provided. Some action is taken according to the input, and then the loop starts running again. This sort of algorithm is known as an *event loop* -- the code loops until a user event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib` provides a number of simple widgets which automatically create an event loop for us. One can create a widget instance, and then tell the widget what function to run when something happens to the widget. Such a function is called a *callback* -- the event loop calls back to the function we give it in order to take some action before starting up again.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple example, let's write a program which displays a curve whose parameters we can change using a slider widget. The callback function will change the frequency of a sine wave, replot the data, and then return.\n",
    "\n",
    " * import the `mathplotlib.widgets` modules.\n",
    " * create some axes and a plot object (in this case a line)\n",
    " * leave a bit of room at the bottom of our axes to put the widget\n",
    " * add a new axes in which to put the slider\n",
    " * create a callback function which gets the new value of the frequency from the slider widget, recomputes the data, and sets the line object's data to the new values.\n",
    " * create the slider object in its set of axes\n",
    " * tell the slider object the name of our callback function"

Because a key_pressed_event is not a graphical widget (it does not involve the plot), when control returns it does not refresh the plot. If you do something in a key_pressed_event callback which is supposed to change the plot, you must call fig.canvas.draw() yourself to make the plot refresh.\n",
