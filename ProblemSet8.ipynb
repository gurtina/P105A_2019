Much of the iron in the Universe is made in Type Ia supernova explosions.\n",

    "Type Ia supernovae are surprisingly uniform in their peak luminosity -- they aren't all pecisely the same, but by various means one can determine their peak luminosity within fairly small errors. Objects which are all of the same luminosity are known as *standard candles*. Because the flux (energy per time per area), what we perceive as brightness, falls off as the square of the distance to a source,\n",

Of course, this depends upon knowning the true luminosity in the first place, hence the use of standard candles.\n",

    "BC in Nicaea in what is now Turkey. Hipparchus first classified stars by their apparent brightness. Of course, he had little idea of what a star was, but he nonetheless placed all of the stars visible to him into six brightness categories call *magnitudes*. Naturally, he put the brightest stars in the first magnitude, so that the dimmest stars (to him) were in magnitude 6. Because the human perception of brightness is proportional to the logarithm of the intensity of light arriving at the eye, Hipparchos' scale is a logarithmic one. The modern definition is that five magnitudes span\n",
    "a factor of one hundred in brightness, so that the ratio in brightness of two sources one magnitude apart is $\\sqrt[\\leftroot{5}\\uproot{2}5]{100}$. Thus, the magnitude of a source with a flux measured as $F$ is\n",

This definition of magnitude, written with a lowercase $m$, is called the *apparent magnitude* -- it is a measure of how bright an object *appears*, and not of how luminous an object actually is.\n",

    "\n",
    "First,  when we look at such a large volume of the Universe, we should really be using Einsten's General Theory of Relativity (GR). One of the differences between Newtonian gravity and GR is that, while the Newtonian theory has one constant in it -- \"big $G$\" -- GR has *two* constants: $G$ and and $\\Lambda$. The second constant, $\\Lambda$, is known as the *cosmological constant*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably have heard the story (due to George Gamov) about how Einstein called $\\Lambda$ his \"biggest blunder\", but $\\Lambda$ is not just a \"fudge factor\" which Einstein put in his theory for dubious reasons -- it is an integral part of GR and should not be left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of viewing the effect of the GR term proportional to $\\Lambda$ is that it represents the mass-energy associated with empty space. Since empty space doesn't emit light, this has come to be known as *Dark Energy*. The notion of empty space, a vacuum, having some energy associated with it is not as crazy as it sounds -- it is a part of the \"standard model\" of particle physics. The only problem is that the standard model predicts it to be about 120 orders of magnitude greater than what was measured from our data!\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest cosmology in GR, then, is determined by the amount of matter in the universe and the amount of dark energy. There is a mutual, attractive gravitational force among all matter in the Universe. This \"pull\" acts against the expansion, causing the rate of expansion to decrease over time. As the Universe expands, the distance between all this matter increases, and the magnitude of this effect decreases over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net effect of dark energy is to cause space to expand. Because the amount of dark energy is proportional to the amount of space, as the Universe expands, the amount of dark energy increases, as does its effect causing the expansion to accelerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosmologists specify the amounts of matter and dark energy in terms of the total amount of mass-energy in the Universe such that spacetime is, at the largest scale, flat, Euclidean space. Since the volume of the Universe is increasing as it expands, the density of these various sorts of mass-energy are also changing with time. The density of mass-energy today which would give a flat spacetime is known as the *critical density*. \n",
